# Scaling Mobs
This is a server side mod that allows for scaling of the attributes health, damage and speed. You can configure it through a file and choose on what days the attributes should be applied/active.

Here's a list of the configuration options that can be found in the `scalingmobs.toml` file within the configuration directory.
